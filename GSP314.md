# Deploy and Manage Cloud Environments with Google Cloud: Challenge Lab

>**NOTE FOR THIS LAB**
>- Create all resources in the `us-east1` region and `us-east1-b` zone, unless otherwise directed.
>- Use the project VPCs.
>- Naming is normally _team-resource_, e.g. an instance could be named **kraken-webserver1**.
>- Allocate cost effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination (and possibly yours), so beware. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share; unless directed, use `n1-standard-1`.

## Task 1: Create the production environment

### Create production network using the Deployment Manager configuration

You can find the DM configuration on your **jumphost** in `/work/dm`.

**1**. Open Cloud Shell.

**2**. SSH into the **kraken-jumphost** instance:
  >`gcloud compute ssh kraken-jumphost --zone us-east1-b`

**3**. Go into the directory where the DM configuration is located and confirm the configuration files exist:
  >`cd /work/dm`

  >`ls -l`

You should see the following output:

**4**. Review the configuration file to see if there is any changes to be made. 
  >`vi prod-network.yaml`

Here, we locate the line to replace the region parameter from "`SET_REGION`" to "`us-east1`":
  >Type `i` to INSERT our input and make the changes, and then save changes and exit by **Escape** and typing `:wq!` and **Enter**.

**5**. Apply the configuration file to build the network.
  >`gcloud deployment-manager deployments create kraken-prod-network --config prod-network.yaml`

### Create the Kubernetes environment 
The application is already created and in the Container Repository.

Create a two (2) node cluster called `kraken-prod` in the `kraken-prod-vpc` (remember to use `--num-nodes` to create 2 nodes only).

>`gcloud container clusters create kraken-prod --zone us-east1-b \`\
>`--num-nodes 2 --machine-type n1-standard-1 \`\
>`--network kraken-prod-vpc \`\
>`--subnetwork kraken-prod-subnet`

Get cluster configuration:
>`gcloud container clusters get-credentials kraken-prod --zone us-east1-b`

### Create the Kubernetes frontend and backend deployments and services 
Use `kubectl` with the files in /work/k8s to create the frontend and backend deployments and services (which will expose the frontend service via a load balancer).

Go to the /work/k8s directory and list the files:

>`cd /work/k8s`

>`ls -l`

Run `kubectl apply -f` for each of the deployment objects and services:

>`kubectl apply -f deployment-prod-backend.yaml`

>`kubectl apply -f deployment-prod-frontend.yaml`

>`kubectl apply -f service-prod-backend.yaml`

>`kubectl apply -f service-prod-frontend.yaml`

## Task 2: Setup the Admin instance
You need to set up an admin machine for the team to use.

### Create the Admin instance 
The instance will be called **kraken-admin**, with a network interface in **kraken-mgmt-subnet** and another in **kraken-prod-subnet**.

>`gcloud compute instances create kraken-admin --zone us-east1-b \`\
>`--machine-type n1-standard-1 \`\
>`--network-interface network=kraken-mgmt-vpc,subnet=kraken-mgmt-subnet \`\
>`--network-interface network=kraken-prod-vpc,subnet=kraken-prod-subnet`

### Monitor the Admin instance
If **CPU utilization** is over **50%** for more than a minute you need to send an email to yourself, as admin of the system.

1. Go to **Navigation Menu**, click **Monitoring > Alerting**.

2. Click **+ CREATE POLICY**

You will see this:

#### **(1) What do you want to track?**

Click **ADD CONDITION** and Enter the following for the fields and leave the rest as default:

- **Target**
  - **Find resource type and metric** 
    - Resource type: `VM instance`
    - Metric: `CPU utilization`
  - **Filter**
    - `instance_name = "kraken-admin"`

- **Configuration**
  - **Condition triggers if**: `Any time series violates`
  - **Condition**: `is above`
  - **Threshold**: `50 %`
  - **For**: `1 minute`

It should show something like this:

Click **ADD** then **NEXT**.

#### **(2) Who should be notified?**

Click on the **Notification Channels** dropdown, then **MANAGE NOTIFICATION CHANNELS**.

For **Email**, click **ADD NEW** and enter your **Email Address** and **Display Name**. 

>For lab purposes, you may use the lab [USERNAME] to fill up the Email and Display Name field.

Click **SAVE**.

Return to the dropdown menu selection, click the Refresh icon (![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85338632/124367659-eaa24500-dc8b-11eb-831e-f1d17bfe921d.png)) to show the email we just entered and select it.

Click **NEXT**.

#### **(3) What are the steps to fix the issue?**
Enter an appropriate **Alert name** for this policy. 

For example, `VM Instance - CPU utilization for kraken-admin over 50%`.

You may include additional info such as instructions or suggestions for solving the problem in the _Documentation_ text area to send out along with the alert. This is optional but highly recommended for use in our real implementations.

After all is done, click **SAVE** to create the policy.

## Task 3: Verify the Spinnaker deployment
